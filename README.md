# Overview
This project demonstrates a threat detection and automated response system designed for an enterprise environment It leverages Active Directory for user authentication, Splunk (SIEM) for real-time event monitoring and alerting, and Shuffle with Slack (SOAR) to orchestrate automated incident response workflow.

The system simulates an adversary attempting unauthorized access via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on a domain-joined test machine. Upon detecting a successful unauthorized login, telemetry is forwarded to Splunk, which triggers alerts and initiates a response workflow on SOAR.

The end-to-end pipeline streamlines detection, alerting, and mitigation processes, enhancing the overall security posture by reducing response time and minimizing human error.

The logical diagram illustrates how communication and data flow are standardized across systems. The scenario simulates an adversary gaining unauthorized access to a domain-joined test machine. This triggers telemetry from the test machine to Splunk, which detects the unauthorized sucessful login through RDP and initiates two actions:

1. Sends an alert notification to Slack, a multi-purpose platform used for communication, threat detection, and incident response as part of this projectâ€™s workflow.

2. Sends a webhook to Shuffle, which triggers an automated SOAR playbook in response to the unauthorized login. The playbook notifies a Security Personnel, who decides to either disable the compromised account or take no action. If the account is disabled, Shuffle & the Domain Controller executes the action, and a confirmation message is sent to Slack.

# Machine Configuration

The project consist of 4 virtual machines, 3 being on the cloud (Oracle Cloud Provider) and 1 being on-prem. The 3 virtual machine on the cloud consist of the Splunk Server, Domain Controller, Domain User/Test Machine. The last virtual machine is on-prem acting as an adversary machine attacking the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Lastly, there's an personal computer that is able to interact with all 4 virtual machine and the entire environment.

![SplunkA8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_SPLUNKA7.png)
*This confirm the connection of the telemetry links between the Test Machine and Domain Controller Machine to the Splunk Server showing real-time Windows Security Event Logs for the purpose of finding Sucessful Unauthorized Logins.*

# Creating Alert for Sucessful Authentication
A sucessful Login on an Windows Environment generate a Window Security Log: Event ID 4624. Under this security log, it can generate 9 different "logon types". Events related to RDP, Event 4624 can generate types of 7 & 10. To simulate an unauthorized RDP login, an alert should be created with a focus on suspicious Source Network Address Values.

![Alert1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_ALERT1.png)
![Alert2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_ALERT2.png)

**1. Modify the query to:**
<br/>
"index=... EventCode=4624 (Logon_Type=7 OR Logon_Type=10) Source_Network_Address=* Source_Network_Address!="-" Source_Network_Address!=129."

**What this Query/Alert do?"**
This Splunk query is designed to detect potentially unauthorized RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) login activity by examining successful Windows login events and filtering based on the source network address.
<br/>
Each component of the query performs a specific function:
   - **"index..."** <br/>
     Searches only for the designated index where Window Security Event Logs are stored.
     
   - **"EventCode=4624"** <br/>
     A specific Window Security log Event that indicates a Sucessful User Logon.
     
   - **"(Logon_Type=7 OR Logon_Type=10)"** <br/>
     Specifies the method of the logon attempts shown. Reference can be found in the chart above
     
   - "Source_Network_Address=*" <br/>
     Indicate a value MUST exist under this field name. Prevent logs where the Source Network Address is missing or Undefined.
     
   - **"Source_Network_Address!="-""** <br/>
     Filter NULL Source Network Address. Excludes events where the source address is the placeholder "-", which often appears when the address isnâ€™t available.
     
   - **"Source_Network_Address!=129."** <br/>
     FILTER OUT PUBLIC IP ADDRESS COMING FROM OUR TRUSTED MACHINE (specific to your configuration). Any number that isn't part of your public ip address for your environment can be consider unauthorize.
      - *DiSCLAIMER: This doesn't involve other environment/circumstances such as Work at Home, Vacations, etc. As a result, the alert may generate false positives if legitimate users connect from outside the 129. IP range. Consider building an allowlist or adding additional filters if needed.*

**2. Test the Query**
<br/>
Initiate a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) from the Adversary Virtual Machine into the Test Machine or the Domain Controller Machine. Since the Adversary VM operates outside the trusted public IP space (129.x.x.x), this action should generate the appropriate Window Event Log.

**3. Create the Alert/Rules**

With the Query inputted, hit **Save As, then Alert**.
<br/>
**Title the Alert** to indicate for Unauthorized Succesful Login (travislocal-UnauthorizedSucessful-Login-RDP). <br/>
**Alert Type**: you can run in any specific interval. <br/>
**Cron Schedule** allow the alert to run at **specific intervals during a time range for precise control over time execution** <br/>
**Cron Expression:** "* * * * *" - This allow the Alert to run every minute for the time range (60 minute). <br/>
**Trigger Actions:** Add action to "Add to Triggered Alerts". This allow the alert to be on the Triggered Alerts list.<br/>

![Alert3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_ALERT3.png)

**Top right of the Splunk Web Interface, Hit Activity then Triggered Alerts. This is where the Unauthorized Succesful Login Alert will be stored when triggered.**

# Slack & Shuffle Integration

**1. Create Account on shuffler.io, the SOAR Platform and create a New Workflow.**
![Shuffle1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_SHUFFLE1.png)

**2. Shuffle Webhook Configuration and Deploment**

Create a **Webhook Trigger** and copy the **Webhook URI**. Head over to Splunk Web Interface and under Alert tab in Search & Reporting, edit the Alert created in the previous part, and **ADD ACTION - Webhook**. Then **Paste Webhook URI**.
![Shuffle2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_SHUFFLE2.png)
![Shuffle3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_SHUFFLE3.png)

*Start the Shuffle Webhook(Splunk-Alert) and it should listen and capture Alerts. (can verify on Adversary Machine and check Details under "Explore Runs" tab on Shuffle.)*

**3. Slack Alert Notification Configuration and Deployment**
- Create an Account on Slack.com  then create an Workspace.
- On Slack, Search for "Slack" App. On the Slack Configuration in Shuffle, hit "+ Authenticate slack"
- Create a New Channel on Slack call "Alerts" where all the Alerts will be posted in. Under Slack app on Shuffle, Add a new Channel and link it to the Alerts channel on Slack.
   - Head over to Slack, and grab the Channel ID under the Alert Channel then input it into the Channel Option on Shuffle.

![Slack1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_SLACK1.png)
![Slack3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_SLACK3.png)
- Under Slack app on Shuffle, create a new "Text" Option, **Alert: $search_name \nTime: $exec.result_time \nUser: $exec.result.user \n Source IP: $exec.result.Source_Network_Address**
  
![Slack2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_SLACK2.png)

With the Webhook and Slack configurated and connected. Either rerun previous "Workflow Runs" or trigger a new Alert. This should output information about the Alert on Slack under the #Alerts channel. Outputting information about the Alert Name, Time, User, and Source IP. 

**4. Shuffle Email Notification Configuration and Deployment**
- Create a New **User Input Trigger** on Slack. Rename it, change the information text, and change the input option to Email. Then connect the User Input Trigger to Slack.
![ShuffleE1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_SHUFFLEEMAIL1.png)
*Changing the parameter under the Information tab will help organize the output of the automated email.*

# Playbook Configuration & Deployment

After Setting up Slack and Shuffle, webhook, Slack Alerts, and Email Notification. The Email output ask to disable the user or not, triggering the playbook.

![Playbook1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_PLAYBOOKLD.png)

**1. "If NO - Do Nothing" Configuration**

For this part of the Playbook, no configuration is needed to be done. The handling of the "If YES - Disable User Account" Configuration will configure this part of the playbook by itself. As with the Email notification, copying the link for false in the "Would you like to disable the user?" email, it will automatically **DO NOTHING**.

**2. "If YES - Disable User Account" Configuration**

To disable an AD account, a connection to LDAP or some other directory protocol must be enable.

- Under Apps on Shuffle, create a new **Active Directory App** and connect it to **User Input**.
- Authenticate Active Directory
   - Enter the Domain Controller Public IP Address under Server.
   - Port 389 for LDAP
   - Enter the Domain Name (travis.local)
   - Enter Administrator Login Name
   - Enter Password for Administrator Account
   - for **base-dn**. Head over to the DC Machine and on PowerShell, **run the command: get-addomain**. Copy the output for the **UserContainer** and paste it into base-dn. Refer to the image below.
   - Use-SSL = True
![PB1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_PLAYBOOK2.png)
![PB2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_PLAYBOOK1.png)

- On the Active Directory Configuration on Slack, **Change "Find Actions" to Disable user**. For the **"Samaccountname", enter the user created for the Test Machine OR use "$exec.result.user"**

![PB3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_PLAYBOOK3.png) <br/>
*To test if the account disable without any dependencies on Shuffle(slack, user input). Only connect the Webhook to Active Directory and then rerun the Workflow for Webhook.*

After Active Directory disable the user, it should send a **Slack Notification stating "Account: [Account Name] has been disabled"**.
- Create a new Slack App on Shuffle
   - Rename it
   - Update Text Option
   - Update Channel (#alert on Slack)
  
![PB4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_PLAYBOOK4.png)

## Troubleshooting Order of Operation for Disabling User

A primary issue with the current configuration of Shuffle is that Slack won't disable the User Account and it wont output an message saying a **Slack Notification saying "Account: [Account Name] has been disabled"** or it will output that message before the Disabling User Operation occurs. With the intended order of operation, this is an major misconfiguration of the workflow.

**SOLUTION**
- **Refresh Workflow on Shuffle.** This fix the issue of the User Account not disabling, **but it cause the Slack Notification to be outputted earlier then expected.**
   - **Solution for Early Slack Notification:** Once Shuffle disable the User, Active Directory will then check the User Attribute, then if it's under the status of DISABLED, it will then update Slack with the Disable User Notification
      - To represent this. Create a new Active Directory App to get User-Attributes.
      - Create a "repeat back to me" (call it "Check AD User") App/Action with the call "$get-user-attributes.attributes.userAccountControl". Connect this to Slack
      - Add a Condition for the connection between Check AD User and Slack.
         - For the source: $get-user-attributes.attributes.userAccountControl
         - contains
         - For the Destination: "ACCOUNTDISABLED"

![PBIS2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/Walkthrough-Screenshots/ADSSDR_PBIS2.png) <br/>
*Refer to Online Sources on how to analyze the connection between the original "Active Directory 1" and the "Update-Notification" App. Understand why it's not sending in the proper order of operation and the solution will become clear.*


**TESTING DISABLE USER ORDER OF OPERATION**
- Start the Webhook (Enable Splunk Alert if needed on Splunk Web Interface)
- Make sure the User Account is enable (TMa)
- Trigger the Alert, it should send a Alert message to Slack and an Email to the inbox. 
- In the email, it ask "Would you like to disable the user?"
     - if this is TRUE click this: ...
        - copy and paste the link on a web broswer. It should redirect to Shuffle asking "What do you want to do?". Hit "continue".
        - The account will be disabled (TMa) and an automated message on Slack will be sent confirming the disabling of the Account: "Account TMa has been disabled."

# Conclusion
This project sucessfully demonstrates a end-to-end workflow for handling unauthorized remote logins by integrating multiple enterprise security technologies into a cohesive threat detection and response system. Leveraging Active Directory for user authentication, Splunk for real-time monitoring and alerting, and Shuffle with Slack for automated incident response, the implementation simulates adversarial RDP access and demonstrates end-to-end threat detection, alerting, and mitigation.

By combining SIEM and SOAR capabilities, the system automates critical response actions, such as disabling compromised accounts and notifying security personnel, thus reducing response time and minimizing human error. The integration of cloud-based virtual machines, network configurations, and directory services illustrates how these technologies can function together in a realistic enterprise environment.

Overall, the project highlights the value of automation in modern cybersecurity operations, showing how technical tools, operational workflows, and security principles can be applied to strengthen an organization's security posture while providing a foundation for further expansion and refinement.
